# OOP_lab_4_Car
Create a class called Car. Upon initialization, it should receive a name, model, and engine (all strings). Create a method called get_info() which will return a string in the following format:
"This is {name} {model} with engine {engine}".

Test Code
car = Car("Kia", "Rio", "1.3L B3 I4")
print(car.get_info())

Output

This is Kia Rio with engine 1.3L B3 I4
